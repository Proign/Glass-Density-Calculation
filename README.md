# Glass-Density-Calculation
Simple application for glass density calculation

This repository presents a software development of a complex that implements methods for calculating the density of glasses by their chemical composition.
The program should work like this:
- The user enters the chemical elements that make up the glass, as well as their percentage in the glass.
- After executing the program algorithm, the glass density is displayed on the screen.
